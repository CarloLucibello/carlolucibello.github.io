## About 

I am an Associate Professor at [Bocconi University][Bocconi] and an open-source contributor, primarily to machine-learning [libraries][Flux] in Julia.  

When not thinking about neural networks or statistical physics, I'm usually raising a kid, reading sci-fi, or dancing lindy hop.

## Research

My current research focuses on the interface between the statistical physics of disordered systems and artificial neural networks. Find my publications on [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.it/citations?user=1IPn2HgAAAAJ&hl=en).

## Code

I contribute extensively to the Julia language ecosystem, particularly to Machine Learning packages. You can find me on [GitHub](https://github.com/CarloLucibello/).

Some of the packages I currently mantain:

- [GraphNeuralNetworks.jl](https://github.com/CarloLucibello/GraphNeuralNetworks.jl)
- [Flux.jl](https://fluxml.ai/)
- [Zygote.jl](https://github.com/FluxML/Zygote.jl)
- [NNLib.jl](https://github.com/FluxML/NNlib.jl)
- [MLUtils.jl](https://github.com/JuliML/MLUtils.jl)
- [MLDatasets.jl](https://github.com/JuliaML/MLDatasets.jl)
- [HuggingFaceDatasets.jl](https://github.com/CarloLucibello/HuggingFaceDatasets.jl)
- [PicoSAT.jl](https://github.com/sisl/PicoSAT.jl)

Some projects that I used to mantain, but not anymore:

- [Graphs.jl](https://github.com/JuliaGraphs/Graphs.jl)
- [Erdos.jl](https://github.com/CarloLucibello/Erdos.jl)
