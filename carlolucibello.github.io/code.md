# Code

## Open Source contributions

I contribute a lot to the Julia language ecosystem, in particular to Machine Learning packages. You will find me [here](https://github.com/CarloLucibello/) on GitHub.

Some of the packages I currently mantain:

- GraphNeuralNetworks.jl
- Flux.jl
- Zygote.jl
- NNLib.jl
- MLUtils.jl
- MLDatasets.jl
- HuggingFaceDatasets.jl

Some projects that I used to mantain, but I'm not actively contributing to:
- Graphs.jl
- Erdos.jl
