### About

I am an Assistant Professor at [Bocconi University][Bocconi] since 2018, an open source contributor ([machine learning libraries](https://fluxml.ai/) for Julia in particular) machine learning packages and a lindy-hop dancer.

### Research

I'm currently working on questions which fall at the interface between the statistical physics of disordered systems and artificial neural networks.
[Here](/research/) I  give a quick overview of my research.
